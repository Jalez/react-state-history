I understand that you'd like to create a separate Vite project for the UndoRedo functionality as a standalone library in the next chat. Here are the instructions for continuing where we left off:

Next Steps: Creating a Standalone UndoRedo Library
We've successfully implemented a StateChange Pattern-based undo/redo system within our mindmap application. The next step is to extract this functionality into a standalone library, which will make it more reusable across projects.

Plan for Next Session
Create a new Vite project for the standalone library:

Set up the library configuration:

Configure Vite for library mode
Add TypeScript declaration file generation
Set up proper exports
Extract and refactor the code:

Move the core undo/redo functionality from UndoRedo to the new project
Remove application-specific code
Create a clean API surface
Key files to include:

Core StateChange types and interfaces
StateChange history store
Utility functions for creating commands
React hooks and context providers
Features to implement:

StateChange creation utilities
StateChange history management
Composite StateChange support
React integration components
Current Structure to Extract
The current implementation includes:

StateChange interface in types/index.ts
StateChange history store in store/useHistoryStateStore.ts
React context in context/StateHistoryContext.tsx
Utilities in utils/commandUtils.ts
Domain-Specific Implementation
In the new library, we should keep the core StateChange Pattern infrastructure but make the domain-specific parts (node commands, edge commands) into examples or optional extensions.

The hooks like useNodeCommands and useEdgeCommands should be used as reference for how consumers can implement their own domain-specific StateChange factories.


Issues: Persistence doesnt seem to be working in the example when I check the persistence checkbox. Also for the sake of simplicity, we shouldnt have two counters that basically perform the same but look different. Reuse components there if at all possible in te Persistent Counter example.
